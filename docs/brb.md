### Control flow operations

1. `mark <mark_name: string>` (code: 0x2):\
    `mark` operation binds its index in the operation sequence to `mark_name`
    so that this index can be jumped to from other parts of the procedure.

2. `goto <mark_name: string>` (code: 0xD):\
    `goto` operation jumps to an operation index bound to `mark_name`.
    to avoid stack corruption cases, only marks in the same procedure can be accessed.

3. `cgoto <src: register> <mark_name: string>` (code: 0xE):\
    `cgoto` operation jumps to an operation index bound to `mark_name`
    only if the value of register `src` is non-zero, otherwise this operation
    is a no-op.
    to avoid stack corruption cases, only marks in the same procedure can be accessed.

4. `proc <proc_name: string>` (code: 0x30):\
    `proc` operation start—ã the definition of procedure with the name `proc_name`.
    It is a compile-time marker and is a no-op at runtime.

5. `call <mark_name: string>` (code: 0x31):\
    `call` operation saves current execution frame
    (e.g. current operation index and stack head position) on the stack
    and jumps to a procedure bound to `mark_name`.

6. `ret` (code: 0x32):\
    `ret` operation rewinds the execution state back to the last saved one
    on the stack, jumping back to operation index fetched from the frame
    and setting stack head to the one fetched from the frame.

7. `endproc` (code: 0x33):\
    `endproc` operation ends the procedure definition. It is only a compile-time marker,
    and is a no-op at runtime.

8. `end` (code: 0x1):\
    `end` operation gracefully stops the execution. It is effectively 
    an alias to the following sequence of operations:
    `set r0 0 sys exit`.\
    This operation is implicitly placed by the assembler at the end of the
    execution sequence, so one is not required to specify it themselves.

### Operations on the stack

1. `var <var_size: integer>` (code: 0x3B):\
    `var` operation allocates `var_size` bytes on the stack, creating a new variable on the local stack frame.

2. `setv <dst: register> <var_id: integer>` (code: 0x3C):\
    `setv` operation sets the value of register `dst` to an address of a local variable with the index specified by `var_id`.
    Variables outside of the local stack frame cannot be accessed.

### Memory manipulation operations

1. `setd <dst: register> <block_name: string>` (code: 0x5):\
    `setd` operation copies address the of data block `block_name` to 
    register `dst`.\
    The difference between memory and data blocks is that data blocks contain predefined data, while memory blocks are simply zero-initialized blocks of memory that are free to be written to.

2. `setm <dst: register> <block_name: string>` (code: 0x7):\
    `setm` operation copies address of the memory block `block_name` to
    register `dst`.

    to register `dst`.

4. `str64 <dst: register> <src: register>` (code: 0x35):\
    `str64` operation stores the value of register `src` at the address
    in register `dst`.

5. `ld32 <dst: register> <src: register>` (code: 0x36):\
    `ld32` operation loads a 32-bit value from the address in register `src`
    to register `dst`. Higher 32 bits of register `dst` are zeroed out.

6. `str32 <dst: register> <src: register>` (code: 0x37):\
    `str32` operation stores 32 lower bits of register `src` at the address
    in register `dst`.

7. `ld16 <dst: register> <src: register>` (code: 0x38):\
    `ld16` operation loads a 16-bit value from the address in register `src`
    to register `dst`. Higher 48 bits of register `dst` are zeroed out.

8. `str16 <dst: register> <src: register>` (code: 0x39):\
    `str16` operation stores 16 lower bits of register `src` at the address
    in register `dst`.

9. `ld8 <dst: register> <src: register>` (code: 0x3A):\
    `ld8` operation loads a 8-bit value from the address in register `src`
    to register `dst`. Higher 56 bits of register `dst` are zeroed out.

10. `str8 <dst: register> <src: register>` (code: 0x3B):\
    `str8` operation stores 8 lower bits of register `src` at the address
    in register `dst`.
    
### System interaction and platform-specific operations

1. `setb <dst: register> <builtin_name: string>` (code: 0x6):\
    `setb` operation copies the runtime value of the built-in value `builtin_name`
    to register `dst`.
    See (Built-ins)[#built-ins] for further information and all defined built-ins.

2. `sys <sys_op_name: string>` (code: 0xC):\
    `sys` operation performs a cross-platform system call bound to `sys_op_name`.
    See (System Calls)[#system-calls] for all defined system calls.

## Built-ins

**Built-ins** are a crossplatform way to get platform- and execution-specific
data, they may have different values on different systems and between different
executions, but they are bound to a name that is constant and universal.

### All defined built-ins

1. `stdin` (index: 0x0):\
    `stdin` is used in operations on file descriptors, it is a special
    read-only file, that represents input for the program, e.g. from the terminal.

2. `stdout` (index: 0x1):\
    `stdout` is used in operations on file descriptors, it is a special
    write-only file, that represents output of the program, e.g. to the terminal.

3. `stderr` (index: 0x2):\
    `stderr` is used in operations on file descriptors, it is a special
    write-only file, that represents error output of the program, e.g. to
    the terminal.

## System Calls

**System Calls** are a crossplatform way to interact with the current system,
they might have different call conventions and implementations on different systems,
but a BRF system call is used the same way on any system that BRF supports.

### All defined system calls

1. `exit` (index: 0x1):\
    `exit` system call sets the exit code and stops the execution.
    Arguments:\
        `<r0>` - an 8-bit unsigned integer that specifies the exit code.

2. `write` (index: 0x2):\
    `write` system call writes data to a file descriptor.\
    Arguments:\
        `<r0>` - writable file descriptor, can be obtained using 
            `open` system call, or can be one a built-in `stdout` or `stderr`.\
        `<r1>` - pointer to the data to be written to the file descriptor.\
        `<r2>` - amount of bytes to be copied from `<r1>` to the file descriptor.\
    Result: `<r0>` - If the call succeded, the value is the amount of bytes actually written to the file descriptor.
                Otherwise, the value will be set to -1.

3. `argc` (index: 0x3):\
    `argc` system call provides the amount of arguments passed to the program, e.g. from a command line.\
    Arguments: none.\
    Result: `<r0>` - a 32-bit integer specifying the amount of provided arguments.

4. `argv` (index: 0x4):\
    `argv` system call provides a pointer to n-th argument, passed to the program.
    Note: the first argument is always the name of the program.\
    Arguments:\
        `<r0>` - index of the requested argument.\
    Result: `<r0>` - pointer to the argument, or NULL pointer if the index provided in `<r0>` is out of range.

5. `read` (index: 0x5):\
    `read` system call reads data from a file descriptor.\
    Arguments:\
        `<r0>` - readable file descriptor, can be obtained using
            `open` system call, or can be a built-in `stdin`.\
        `<r1>` - address, to which data will be read.\
        `<r2>` - amount of bytes to be read to `<r1>` from file descriptor.\
    Result:  `<r0>` - If the call succeded, the value is the amount of bytes actually read from the file descriptor.
        Otherwise, the value will be set to -1.

6. `get_errno` (index: 0x6):\
    `get_errno` system call gets the current error code. Error code is set by other system calls in case of failure, and the code itself describes the cause of failure. Alternatively, error code can be set by the application using `set_errno` system call.\
    Arguments: none.\
    Result: `<r0>` - a 32-bit integer specifying the error code.\

7. `set_errno` (index: 0x7):\
    `set_errno` system call sets the internal error code.\
